# Chest X-ray for Pneumonia Detection

üåü Final Presentation Milestone! üåü

Proud to share my work on **‚ÄúChest X-ray for Pneumonia Detection‚Äù**, developed as part of my Huawei internship and aligned with my graduation project. This journey into deep learning involved building and refining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-rays, aiming to detect and categorize pneumonia types accurately.

## Project Overview

This project aims to utilize deep learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images for the detection and classification of pneumonia. It includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Model building and training
- Evaluation and testing
- Visualization of results

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to **Dr. Mahmoud Farag** for his mentorship and support throughout this project. I am excited to explore future applications in medical imaging and AI!
